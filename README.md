## üìù Assignment #1 (Deadline 16/11/2022)

Cairo University  
Faculty of Computers and Artificial Intelligence  
Operating Systems Course (Spring 2023)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Requirements

* You must use only the MINIMUM number of the follwing components: Full-adders, 4x1 Multiplexers, 2x1 Multiplexers, or, and, not, xor gates.
* A full-adder counts only as 1 component, not counting the small components inside. Also, a multiplexer counts as 1 component.
* At the beginning of the file, write a comment including the components you have used and the number of them.
* You must implement multiplexers using structural Verilog descriptions as explained in figure 2-4 in section 2-3 in book "Computer system architecture".
* The input is two selection inputs, and two signed integers in 2's complement form: A and B, each integer is 3-bits.
* The output is a signed integer in 2's complement from: G, its size is 3-bits.
* When the selection inputs are 00, G = A-1
* When the selection inputs are 01, G = A+B
* When the selection inputs are 10, G = A-B
* When the selection inputs are 11, G = -B
* You must provide a test bench that tests all aspects of the implemented circuit with at least 40 test cases on various input values.
* You are not allowed to use behavioral Verilog descriptions (if, switch, ..etc) for multiplexers or any other aspects except for test bench.
* Use structured Verilog descriptions for all aspects, except for test bench, so you can use behavioral Verilog description for test bench only.
* The Verilog HDL code must be able to be compiled in the same way the provided lab samples are compiled with the instructions at top of them.
* Half the mark is dedicatd to comments explaining the code before each code line and test cases.
